The Target executives were taken aback.

They had just learned that their new CEO, Brian Cornell, had been out on his own with customers, incognito, exploring one of the company's stores.

It was a big departure from the way the process-heavy discount retailer had always operated. Store visits, ostensibly intended as intelligence-gathering missions, were meticulously planned affairs, only slightly less formal than, say, a presidential visit. Every relevant national manager and local functionary would be notified in advance, each step choreographed, the "regular shoppers" handpicked and vetted. About the only thing missing was a brass band playing "Hail to the Chief."
